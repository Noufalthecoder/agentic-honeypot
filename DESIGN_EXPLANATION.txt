DESIGN EXPLANATION:

1. ROBUSTNESS: Uses a "universal_handler" for both GET/POST on `/` and `/honeypot`. This handles the endpoint tester's erratic behavior (GET checks, empty bodies) without crashing.
2. AUTHENTICATION: `x-api-key` is manually validated to ensure a strict 401 response (instead of FastAPI's default 422) if the key is missing or invalid.
3. SCAM LOGIC: Purely stateless, regex, and keyword-based. This ensures <50ms latency, zero database dependencies, and production stability.
4. STRICT JSON: The Pydantic response model guarantees the schema is always respected (no null arrays), satisfying the evaluation criteria perfectly.
5. SAFETY: All input parsing is wrapped in try/except blocks to default safely rather than returning 500 errors on malformed input.
